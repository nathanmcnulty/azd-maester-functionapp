# azd-maester-functionapp

Deploys a production-style Maester automation solution on Azure with:

- Azure Function App (PowerShell 7.4, Flex Consumption FC1 by default, timer-triggered)
- Managed identity + Graph permissions
- Storage-backed report history (`archive`) and latest pointer (`latest/latest.html`)
- Optional App Service + Easy Auth portal in WebApp mode

## Quickstart (recommended)

After `azd init -t nathanmcnulty/azd-maester-functionapp`, run from the template root:

`azd up`
## Versioning and shared components

This template uses the stable Maester module `2.2.0`. Shared azd hooks,
permission setup, and the optional report web app are vendored from
`nathanmcnulty/azd-reference` and recorded in `azd-components.lock.json`.

The original multi-variant catalog remains available at
[`nathanmcnulty/azd-maester`](https://github.com/nathanmcnulty/azd-maester) while
the migration is being completed.

The original multi-variant catalog remains available at
[`nathanmcnulty/azd-maester`](https://github.com/nathanmcnulty/azd-maester) while
the migration is being completed., the preprovision wizard prompts for:

- Include Web App / Exchange / Teams / Azure
- Security group object ID (required when Web App is enabled)
- Azure RBAC scopes (when Azure is enabled)
- Optional mail recipient

For non-interactive runs (`azd up --no-prompt`), if `AZURE_RESOURCE_GROUP` is set, `preup` creates it automatically when missing.

## Advanced options (optional)

You can optionally enable additional data collection/connectivity for Maester by enabling one or more include options in the `azd up`

- `IncludeExchange`
  - Ensures the `ExchangeOnlineManagement` module is available at runtime (via managed dependencies).
  - Grants the Function App managed identity the Exchange app permission required for app-only Exchange Online access.
  - Creates/links an Exchange service principal for the managed identity and assigns the Exchange RBAC role `View-Only Configuration` (best-effort).
- `IncludeTeams`
  - Ensures the `MicrosoftTeams` module is available at runtime (via managed dependencies).
  - Assigns the Entra directory role `Teams Reader` to the Function App managed identity.
- `IncludeAzure`
  - Grants Azure RBAC `Reader` to the Function App managed identity at one or more scopes.
  - Scopes can be management groups and/or subscriptions.

### Permission behavior

- Azure RBAC, Entra directory roles, Exchange assignments, and Microsoft Graph app-role assignments are separate authorities.
- Some environments already have the required Microsoft Graph permissions consented and assigned. If Graph consent has not been completed previously, the deployment may require a **Global Administrator or Privileged Role Administrator**. See the selected profile and permission sections for solution-specific details.
- If a step fails due to missing privileges, the scripts will:
  - Prompt you to **Stop** or **Skip** in interactive runs.
  - Default to **Skip + continue** in non-interactive runs (CI).
- Toggling an option from `Yes` to `No` in a later `azd up`

- Revocation/best-effort cleanup runs on `azd down` (predown hook).

What this does:

- runs preprovision checks/auth + interactive wizard
- provisions infra and runs postprovision setup + validation hooks

## Modes

- **Quick**: Function App + Storage
- **WebApp**: Quick + Web App (Entra auth restricted by security group)

Defaults:

- `PERMISSION_PROFILE=Extended`
- `WEB_APP_SKU=F1`
- resource group pattern: `rg-<environment>-<location>` (override with `AZURE_RESOURCE_GROUP`)

## Operations

- Remove environment + Azure resources (includes predown cleanup):
  `azd down -e <env> --force --purge`
- Optionally remove local azd env:
  `azd env remove <env> --force`

### Cleanup details

`azd down` runs `scripts/Run-AzdPreDown.ps1`, which performs best-effort cleanup for tenant/scope-level assignments created by advanced options, including:

- Teams directory role assignments (`Teams Reader`) created by this environment
- Azure RBAC role assignments created by this environment (at selected scopes)
- Exchange Online permissions/assignments created by this environment (best-effort)

The generated setup summary in `outputs/<env>-setup-summary.md` includes tracked assignment IDs used for cleanup.

## Script map

- azd hooks: `scripts/Run-AzdPreUp.ps1`, `scripts/Run-AzdPreProvision.ps1`, `scripts/Run-AzdPostProvision.ps1`, `scripts/Run-AzdPreDown.ps1`
- Internal setup/validation: `scripts/Setup-PostDeploy.ps1`, `scripts/Invoke-FunctionValidation.ps1`
- Function deployment: `scripts/Deploy-FunctionCode.ps1`

## Runtime behavior

- Weekly schedule (Sunday midnight UTC). To run at a different time or frequency, edit the `schedule` value in `src/MaesterTimerTrigger/function.json` (e.g. `"0 30 6 * * 1"` for Monday 6:30 UTC), then re-deploy the function code.
- Default plan: FC1 (Flex Consumption) — serverless, pay-per-execution, 30-minute timeout. Alternatively set `FUNCTION_APP_PLAN` to `Y1` (Consumption, 10-minute max) or `B1` (App Service Basic, no timeout limit)
- FC1 does not use managed dependencies; modules are bundled into the deployment zip by `scripts/Deploy-FunctionCode.ps1`. Y1/B1 use `requirements.psd1` for auto-installation.
- Runner script: `src/MaesterTimerTrigger/run.ps1`
- Outputs:
  - `archive/maester-report-<timestamp>.html.gz`
  - `latest/latest.html`
- In WebApp mode, latest report is published to Web App `index.html`
- Entra auth via app registration is configured automatically. Existing Microsoft Graph consent and app-role assignments are reused; if they are not already present, the first run may require a **Global Administrator or Privileged Role Administrator**.
- Signed-in deployment user is granted `Storage Blob Data Reader` on the solution storage account
- Blob soft delete is enabled for 1 day, with blob versioning disabled
- Archive uploads are gzip compressed and written directly to Cool tier
- Lifecycle policy moves `archive` blobs to Cold tier after 180 days and deletes after 365 days
- Key resources are tagged and protected with `CanNotDelete` locks by default
- Function App identity uses `Website Contributor` (least privilege for web content publish) on the optional Web App

## Security recommendations

This solution is reasonably secure, but there are additional controls you may choose to implement based on your organization requirements:

- **Storage private networking:** Use Private Endpoint + storage firewall rules to restrict data plane access to approved networks only.
- **Function App networking:** Use VNet integration and private endpoints for network isolation.
- **Web App private networking:** Use App Service Private Endpoint and access restrictions if your organization requires private-only ingress.
- **Centralized logging:** Send resource logs/metrics to a central Log Analytics workspace (or SIEM) for audit and incident response.
- **Conditional Access:** Apply tenant-wide baseline Conditional Access policies for user sign-in controls (MFA, device/risk posture).
